# Overlook InfraTech Support Policies

Our GitHub namespace contains many repositories. Currently, most of the public projects are
mirrors of the original `puppetlabs` repositories. These will soon live in their own home.
While the OpenPuppet project is forming, the issue queues of these repositories **are not monitored**.
If you need help with these projects, please see below for our Support services. If you need
to file a bug you may do so, but don't expect it to be reviewed for an indeterminate time period.

The modules in this GitHub org are not supported and you should not use them. They're only mirrors
and will be relocated soon.


## Puppet or OpenPuppet support contracts

We offer Enterprise level support for legacy open source Puppet infrastructure or for
infrastractures built on the (still forming) OpenPuppet distribution. We will provide best-effort
support on integrations or other components of your infrastructure. Please see our
[services page](https://overlookinfratech.com/services/) for more information.

We do not support Puppet Enterprise, which you can find at https://www.puppet.com/support.


## Full ecosystem support

We provide best effort support for any ***open source*** modules or tooling in the Puppet ecosystem,
regardless of the author. Any fixes to the moddule/tool will be contributed upstream for everyone
in the community to benefit from. Note that often our suggested solutions will involve
migrating to a more actively supported Vox Pupuli module. Please see our
[services page](https://overlookinfratech.com/services/) for more information.
