## Welcome to the Overlook InfraTech community 👋

Overlook InfraTech is a public benefit company founded under the radical premise that the company exists to serve the community. We literally have our committment to the Open Source ethos written into our bylaws.
We do this by focusing on ecosystem value rather than only on ways to extract resources from a target market.

The name Overlook harkens back to our roots as Puppet's Open Source Stewards group. The common area of our Portland office was downtown looking out over the waterfront and festivals of all kinds. We'd often organize Engineering outings to the Oregon Brewfest across the street, and every Friday afternoon we'd gather to socialize while we finished up tasks for the week. This common area was called _The Overlook_ and this is my silly Pekingese dog, Hambone, giving the view his stamp of approval.


### 🎪 An interconnected community

You can get involved in the OpenPuppet community by connecting at events, getting or giving help in any of our many channels, sharing modules on the Forge, contributing code, docs, or any of your valuable insights--and many other ways, too! However you decide to jump in, we know you’ll learn a lot and enjoy meeting the smart, friendly people who make up the Puppet community. Maybe you'll even fall in with our good friends at [🦊 Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org)!

### 🏘️ The OpenPuppet project

Overlook InfraTech is sponsoring and stewarding the community driven OpenPuppet project. This is a completely open source Puppet distribution, which we hope to eventually become the standard upstream source.

See our (tbd) migration guide for information on how to adopt it.


### 🎁 Contributing to the ecosystem

Community contributions are awesome and part of the way that we continue to evolve and solve the problems of today. We want to keep it as easy as possible to participate and make contributions. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things, of course!
