## Welcome to the OpenPhoenix community üëã

Like the mythical bird, OpenPhoenix has risen from the ashes of what used to be Open Source Puppet.
This name is a nod to the Core Puppet team, codenamed *Phoenix*, which kept the dream alive for
many years with little to no support. We are still in the process of forming and architecting
our governance, so follow this space!

OpenPhoenix is fully Puppet‚Ñ¢Ô∏è compatible, so modules from the Forge will work, examples and guidelines
from books will all work, etc. All the OSP / Puppetserver / PuppetDB / etc docs from puppet.com/docs
apply. When we inevitably end up diverging, we will document that and create our own docs space.


### üé™ An interconnected community

You can get involved in the OpenPhoenix community by connecting at events, getting or giving help in any of our many channels, sharing modules on the Forge, contributing code, docs, or any of your valuable insights--and many other ways, too! However you decide to jump in, we know you‚Äôll learn a lot and enjoy meeting the smart, friendly people who make up the OpenPhoenix community. Maybe you'll even fall in with our good friends at [ü¶ä Vox Pupuli](https://voxpupuli.org)!

Don't forget that all participation is governed by our [Code of conduct](https://voxpupuli.org/coc/).


### üèòÔ∏è Sponsorship

Overlook InfraTech is sponsoring and stewarding the community driven OpenPhoenix project. This is a
completely open source Puppet‚Ñ¢Ô∏è distribution, which we hope to eventually become the standard
upstream source.

See our [installation guide](https://overlookinfratech.com/downloads/) for information on how to
start using it. The packages are currently straght rebuilds of the last releases from Puppet, Inc.
but will soon be rebranded to OpenPhoenix.


### üéÅ Contributing to the ecosystem

Community contributions are awesome and part of the way that we continue to evolve and solve the problems of today. We want to keep it as easy as possible to participate and make contributions. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things, of course!

* If you'd like to contribute to Vox Pupuli modules, then check out [their contributor's guide](https://voxpupuli.org/contributing/).
* For contributing to third-party modules, please see the contribution guidelines in the module's repository. If there is no guideline, then use your best judgement. Check the closed and open issues to see if you're attacking a known issue and follow [best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/best-practices-for-pull-requests).
* To contribute to the OpenPhoenix project, follow [our contributor's guide](https://github.com/overlookinfra/OpenPuppet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
* For all other projects in this organization; thank you, but we are not inviting contributions while we're working on forming the OpenPhoenix project.

### üéüÔ∏è Reporting issues

We use GitHub Issues exclusively. Please reporting problems directly on each repository.
